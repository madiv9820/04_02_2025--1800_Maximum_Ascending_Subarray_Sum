- ### Intuition
    The problem requires finding the maximum sum of an ascending subsequence in a given list of numbers. The subsequence should contain consecutive elements where each element is strictly greater than the one before it.

    - #### Key Observations:
        - The sum of an ascending subsequence can only be extended as long as each subsequent element is greater than the previous one.
        - Once an element is found that is not greater than the previous one, the current subsequence ends.
        - By iterating through the array and checking each possible subsequence, we can find the one with the largest sum.

- ### Approach
    1. **Initialization**:
        - Start by initializing a variable `max_Ascending_Sum` to keep track of the maximum sum found during the process.
    
    2. **Iterate Over the List**:
        - For each element in the list, treat it as the starting point of an ascending subsequence.
        - Initialize the `current_Ascending_Sum` to be the value of the starting element.

    3. **Check Ascending Sequence**:
        - Use a nested loop to check the next elements in the list.
        - If the next element is greater than the previous one, add it to the `current_Ascending_Sum`.
        - If an element is found that is not greater than the previous one, break the inner loop.

    4. **Update Maximum Sum**:
        - After each subsequence is checked, compare the `current_Ascending_Sum` with the `max_Ascending_Sum` and update it if the current sum is larger.

    5. **Return the Result**:
        - After all elements have been processed, return the `max_Ascending_Sum`, which holds the largest sum found.

- ### Code Implementation
    - **Python Solution**
        ```python3 []
        class Solution:
            def maxAscendingSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
                # Initialize the variable to store the maximum sum found so far
                max_Ascending_Sum = 0
                
                # Get the length of the input list
                n = len(nums)

                # Outer loop: Iterate through each element in the list
                for i in range(n):
                    # Initialize the current ascending sum to be the value of the current element
                    current_Ascending_Sum = nums[i]
                    
                    # Inner loop: Check subsequent elements to see if they form an ascending sequence
                    for j in range(i+1, n):
                        # If the current element is greater than the previous one, continue the ascending sum
                        if nums[j] > nums[j-1]: current_Ascending_Sum += nums[j]
                        # If the sequence is no longer ascending, break out of the inner loop
                        else: break
                    
                    # Update the maximum ascending sum if the current ascending sum is greater
                    max_Ascending_Sum = max(max_Ascending_Sum, current_Ascending_Sum)

                # Return the maximum ascending sum found
                return max_Ascending_Sum
        ```
    - **C++ Solution**
        ```cpp []
        class Solution {
        public:
            int maxAscendingSum(vector<int>& nums) {
                // Initialize the variable to store the maximum ascending sum found so far
                int max_Ascending_Sum = 0;
                
                // Get the size of the input vector
                int n = nums.size();

                // Outer loop: Iterate through each element in the vector
                for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
                    // Initialize the current ascending sum to be the value of the current element
                    int current_Ascending_Sum = nums[i];
                    
                    // Inner loop: Check subsequent elements to see if they form an ascending sequence
                    for(int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
                        // If the current element is greater than the previous one, continue adding to the sum
                        if(nums[j] > nums[j - 1]) current_Ascending_Sum += nums[j];
                        // If the sequence is no longer ascending, break out of the inner loop
                        else break;
                    }

                    // Update the maximum ascending sum if the current ascending sum is greater
                    max_Ascending_Sum = max(max_Ascending_Sum, current_Ascending_Sum);
                }

                // Return the maximum ascending sum found
                return max_Ascending_Sum;
            }
        };
        ```

- ### Time Complexity
    - The time complexity of this approach is **$O(n^2)$**, where `n` is the length of the input list. This is because for each element, we may need to check subsequent elements in the list to form an ascending subsequence.
    - The outer loop runs `n` times, and the inner loop, in the worst case, could run `n-1`, `n-2`, ..., 1 times, leading to a total of approximately $(\frac{n\times(n-1)}{2})$, which simplifies to **$O(n^2)$**.

- ### Space Complexity
    - The space complexity is **$O(1)$** because we are only using a constant amount of extra space (for variables like `max_Ascending_Sum` and `current_Ascending_Sum`), regardless of the input size.
